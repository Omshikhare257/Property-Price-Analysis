- **Price Prediction**: Machine learning model to estimate property prices based on various features
- **User-Friendly Filters**: Easily segment data by bedrooms, furnishing status, price range, etc.
- **Detailed Property Listings**: View and sort complete property details
- **Year-wise Predictions**: Forecast property prices for future years

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required libraries: streamlit, pandas, numpy, plotly, scikit-learn

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/property-price-analysis.git
cd property-price-analysis
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`

## üìù Usage Guide

### Data Analysis & Visualization

1. Upload your property data CSV file through the file uploader
2. Use the sidebar filters to segment data by:
   - Location (State and specific locality)
   - Price range
   - Bedrooms configuration (1 RK, 1 BHK, 2 BHK, etc.)
   - Furnishing status
   - Enterprise/Builder
3. Explore the interactive charts and property listings including:
   - Market overview with key metrics
   - Year-wise price analysis
   - Price distribution
   - Price vs Area relationship

### Price Prediction

1. Click "Train Price Prediction Model" to build the machine learning model
2. Enter property details:
   - Area (sqft)
   - Bedrooms configuration
   - Bathrooms
   - Floor and total floors
   - Age and parking
   - Metro distance
   - Furnishing status and facing direction
   - Location
3. Click "Estimate Price" to get the predicted property price

## üìä Required Data Format

Your CSV file should include these columns (not all are mandatory):

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| location | Property location (area/locality) |
| state | State/Province of the property |
| price | Property price (in lakhs) |
| sqft | Property area in square feet |
| bedrooms | Number of bedrooms (can be 1 RK, 1 BHK, etc.) |
| bathrooms | Number of bathrooms |
| floor | Floor number of the property |
| total_floors | Total number of floors in the building |
| age_years | Age of the property in years |
| parking | Number of parking spots |
| metro_distance_km | Distance to nearest metro station in km |
| furnishing | Furnishing status (Unfurnished, Semi-Furnished, Fully Furnished) |
| facing | Direction the property faces (North, South, etc.) |
| enterprise | Builder/Developer name |
| price_per_sqft | Price per square foot |

Example row:
```
Whitefield,Karnataka,85.5,1200,2,2,3,5,2,1,1.5,Unfurnished,North,BuilderA,7125
```

## üîç How It Works

1. **Data Processing**: 
   - The app loads and processes property data
   - Handles data type conversions (e.g., converting bedroom values to RK/BHK format)
   - Calculates additional metrics like price per square foot

2. **Location Analysis**: 
   - Calculates location-based statistics
   - Groups properties by location and state for comparison

3. **Machine Learning**: 
   - Uses Linear Regression to predict property prices
   - Features are standardized for better model performance
   - Handles both numeric and categorical features with one-hot encoding

4. **Visualization**: 
   - Creates interactive visualizations using Plotly
   - Offers year-wise trend analysis
   - Provides price distribution and correlation plots

## üõ†Ô∏è Machine Learning Model

The application uses a Linear Regression model to predict property prices based on:
- Numeric features: area, bedrooms, bathrooms, floor, etc.
- Categorical features: location, state, furnishing status, etc.
- All features are standardized using StandardScaler for better performance

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- Adding more advanced ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Time series forecasting for future price trends
- User authentication and saved preferences
- Export functionality for reports and predictions
- Interactive map visualization for location-based analysis
