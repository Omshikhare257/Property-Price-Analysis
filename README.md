| location | Property location (area/locality) |
| state | State/Province of the property |
| price | Property price (in lakhs) |
| sqft | Property area in square feet |
| bedrooms | Number of bedrooms (can be 1 RK, 1 BHK, etc.) |
| bathrooms | Number of bathrooms |
| floor | Floor number of the property |
| total_floors | Total number of floors in the building |
| age_years | Age of the property in years |
| parking | Number of parking spots |
| metro_distance_km | Distance to nearest metro station in km |
| furnishing | Furnishing status (Unfurnished, Semi-Furnished, Fully Furnished) |
| facing | Direction the property faces (North, South, etc.) |
| enterprise | Builder/Developer name |
| price_per_sqft | Price per square foot |

Example row:
```
Whitefield,Karnataka,85.5,1200,2,2,3,5,2,1,1.5,Unfurnished,North,BuilderA,7125
```

## üöÄ Usage

1. Upload your property data CSV file through the file uploader
2. Use the sidebar filters to segment data by location, price range, bedrooms, etc.
3. Explore the interactive charts and property listings
4. Train the price prediction model and get estimates for specific property configurations

## üß† Machine Learning Model

The application uses a Linear Regression model to predict property prices based on:
- Numeric features (area, bedrooms, bathrooms, floor, etc.)
- Categorical features (location, state, furnishing status, etc.) using one-hot encoding
- Standardized scaling for better model performance

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- Adding more advanced ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Time series forecasting for future price trends
- User authentication and saved preferences
- Export functionality for reports and predictions
- Interactive map visualization for location-based analysis
